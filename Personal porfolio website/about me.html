    <h1  style="text-align: center;color: rgb(131, 11, 235); "> About Me</h1>
    <h1>I was born and raised in Smalltown, USA, where I developed a love for puzzles and problem-solving at a young age. 
        This passion led me to the world of coding in high school, and I`ve been hooked ever since. 
        In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, and playing the piano. I believe these activities have helped me become more creative and patientâ€”qualities that are essential in programming.</h1>
